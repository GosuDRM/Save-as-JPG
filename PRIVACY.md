# Privacy Policy

**Save as JPG** is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our browser extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**I do not collect any data.** Period.

Save as JPG does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or browsing data. The extension operates entirely locally on your device.

## How the Extension Works

When you use Save as JPG to convert an image:

1. The image is fetched directly from the source website to your browser
2. The conversion to JPEG format happens **100% locally** in your browser
3. The converted image is saved to your device
4. **No data ever leaves your browser** or is sent to any external server

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires certain browser permissions to function. Here's why:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `contextMenus` | Adds "Save as JPG" to the right-click menu |
| `downloads` | Saves converted images to your computer |
| `storage` | Stores your preferences (quality, background color) locally |
| `activeTab` | Accesses the image you clicked on |
| `offscreen` | Fallback canvas conversion when OffscreenCanvas is unavailable |
| `notifications` | Shows error messages when image conversion fails |
| `<all_urls>` | Fetches images from any website for local conversion |

## Local Storage

The extension stores only your preferences locally in your browser:
- JPEG quality setting (default: 100%)
- Background color for transparent images (default: white)
- "Save As" dialog preference (default: off)

This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the extension.

## Third-Party Services

Save as JPG does **not** use any third-party services, analytics, tracking, or telemetry. There are no external API calls, no data collection endpoints, and no advertising.

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the complete source code at:

## Changes to This Policy

If I ever change this privacy policy, I will update this document and the "Last updated" date below.
